      <div class="text-h5 text-weight-bold q-mb-md">
        3. WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?

        <strong>In Short:</strong> We may share information in specific situations described in this
        section and/or with the following third parties.
      </p>

      <p class="q-mb-xl">
        We may need to share your personal information in the following situations:
      </p>

      <ul class="q-mb-xl">
        <li>
          <strong>Business Transfers.</strong> We may share or transfer your information in
          connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing,
          or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>When we use Google Maps Platform APIs.</strong> We may share your information with
          certain Google Maps Platform APIs (e.g., Google Maps API, Places API). Google Maps uses
          GPS, Wi-Fi, and cell towers to estimate your location. GPS is accurate to about 20 meters,
          while Wi-Fi and cell towers help improve accuracy when GPS signals are weak, like indoors.
          This data helps Google Maps provide directions, but it is not always perfectly precise.

        <strong>In Short:</strong> We may use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect and
        store your information.
      </p>

      <p class="q-mb-xl">
        We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and pixels) to gather

        maintain the security of our Services and your account, prevent crashes, fix bugs, save your

      <p class="q-mb-xl">
        We also permit third parties and service providers to use online tracking technologies on
        our Services for analytics and advertising, including to help manage and display
        advertisements, to tailor advertisements to your interests, or to send abandoned shopping
        cart reminders (depending on your communication preferences). The third parties and service
        providers use their technology to provide advertising about products and services tailored
        to your interests which may appear either on our Services or on other websites.

      <p class="q-mb-xl">
        To the extent these online tracking technologies are deemed to be a "sale"/"sharing" (which

        state laws, you can opt out of these online tracking technologies by submitting a request as
        described below under section "DO UNITED STATES RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?"

        <strong>In Short:</strong> If you choose to register or log in to our Services using a
        social media account, we may have access to certain information about you.
      </p>

      <p class="q-mb-xl">
        Our Services offer you the ability to register and log in using your third-party social
        media account details (like your Facebook or X logins). Where you choose to do this, we will
        receive certain profile information about you from your social media provider. The profile
        information we receive may vary depending on the social media provider concerned, but will
        often include your name, email address, friends list, and profile picture, as well as other
        information you choose to make public on such a social media platform.
      </p>

      <p class="q-mb-xl">
        We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are described in this
        Privacy Notice or that are otherwise made clear to you on the relevant Services. Please note
        that we do not control, and are not responsible for, other uses of your personal information
        by your third-party social media provider. We recommend that you review their privacy notice
        to understand how they collect, use, and share your personal information, and how you can
        set your privacy preferences on their sites and apps.

      <p class="q-mb-xl">
        We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes
        set out in this Privacy Notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by
        law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will
        require us keeping your personal information for longer than the period of time in which
        users have an account with us.
      </p>

      <p class="q-mb-xl">
        When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we
        will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example,
        because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely
        store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is
        possible.
      </p>

      <div class="text-h5 text-weight-bold q-mb-md">7. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</div>
      <p class="q-mb-md">
        <strong>In Short:</strong> We aim to protect your personal information through a system of
        organizational and technical security measures.
      </p>

      <p class="q-mb-xl">
        We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security
        measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However,
        despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission
        over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so
        we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third
        parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or
        modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information,
        transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You
        should only access the Services within a secure environment.
      </p>

      <div class="text-h5 text-weight-bold q-mb-md">8. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</div>
      <p class="q-mb-md">
        <strong>In Short:</strong> You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time,
        depending on your country, province, or state of residence.
      </p>

      <p class="q-mb-xl">
        <strong>Withdrawing your consent:</strong> If we are relying on your consent to process your
        personal information, which may be express and/or implied consent depending on the
        applicable law, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw
        your consent at any time by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the
        section "HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?" below.
      </p>

      <p class="q-mb-xl">
        However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its

        <li>Log in to your account settings and update your user account.</li>
        <li>
          Upon your request to terminate your account, we will deactivate or delete your account and

      <div class="text-h5 text-weight-bold q-mb-md">9. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</div>
      <p class="q-mb-xl">
        Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a
        Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference
        not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this
        stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been
        finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other
        mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a
        standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform
        you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Notice.
      </p>

      <p class="q-mb-xl">
        California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser DNT signals.
        Because there currently is not an industry or legal standard for recognizing or honoring DNT
